No satisfactory answer was found to her \\npain, and it was refractory through nerve block and high doses \\nof opioid pain medications. CT torso shows progressive \\nmetastatic disease burden.\\n\\nAfter discussion with patient, her family, palliative care, and \\nprimary oncology team, we have decided to transition patient to \\npalliative focused care with discharge to home hospice.\\n\\n# Chronic abdominal pain: Although there is no clear etiology \\nfor her pain, may be related to prior pancreaticresection on \\n___ with recent worsening due to increasing intraabdominal \\ntumor burden. Exam is generally unremarkable and CT showed no \\nobvious new cause of pain.

Nutrition \\nrecommended tube feeds. Initial conservative plan with \\ndronabinol to stimulate appetite and nutritional supplements \\nfailed due to continued weight loss. On ___ dobhoff tube was \\nplaced and tube feeds were started. Received several days of \\nthiamine and no sign of refeeding syndrome, although did have \\naspiration. After discussion with patient and family, have DC'd \\nTF's prior to discharge to hospice.\\n\\n# Diarrhea: Intermittent problem during hospitalization.

Loaded with digoxin \\nand continued on home metoprolol succinate 100mg bid. On ___ had \\nepisode in which diltiazem likely caused hypotension but patient \\nremained clinically perfused and with normal lactate, as \\ndiltiazem was held her BPs recovered but she went into \\naccelerated AF again on ___ in AM was loaded with digoxin again \\nas level <0.4 and maintenance dose was increased. Level now at \\ngoal at 0.7. Plan to continue metoprolol 200mg daily (100 XL \\nbid) and digoxin maintenance dose 0.125mg daily for now.

Monitor for \\ns/s of digoxin toxicity as her cancer progresses and consider \\nstopping digoxin empirically or monitoring levels as needed\\n- Have stopped apixiban this admission (as was for stroke ppx in \\nafib)\\n- Prior trials of high levels of IV opioids, including PCA did \\nnot provide significant relief but did cause encephaloopathy\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1.
